**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed: Missing Information in Call summary event when the browser is closed during an ongoing call.
* Fixed: Issue where, for the first call post initialization of the SDK, input audio was getting picked from the device microphone even if an external Bluetooth device was added before calling.

## v2.2.1 (released@ 01-02-2021)
**Features**

* Added: TypeScript support for Plivo Browser SDK
* Added: Network change improvements for Plivo Browser SDK
* Added: Improvements in events that were getting emitted during mute and unmute

## v2.1.36 (released@ 10-12-2020)
**Bug Fixes**
* Fixed: Issue where incoming calls were not ringing in desktop browsers as well when the tab with the call was in background. This is the expected behavior in mobile browsers but not desktop ones.
* Fixed: Issue where an ongoing browser call would face a one-way audio issue (remote user won't be able to hear the browser app user) if the bluetooth audio device being used by the browser app user got disconnected and switched to another audio input device.

## v2.1.35 (released@ 19-11-2020)
**Bug Fixes**
* Fixed: Issue where client name was being sent as 'Chrome' as part of Call Answered and Call Summary events even for calls made from Microsoft Edge browser. Now the value sent will be 'Edge'.
* Fixed: Issue where setting the configuration parameter 'dscp' as true was not behaving as intended and all UDP packets were still being set with DSCP Class CS0 (default class) instead of DSCP class EF (Expedited Forwarding) which is the expected behavior. Being set with EF ensures packets being tagged as high priority by network routers leading to lower chances of said packets being dropped and minimum per-hop delays.
* Fixed: Issue where, on receiving an incoming mobile browser call with the browser in background, the phone would start ringing despite a visual notification not possible (due to limitations imposed from browsers) and the customer having no way to find out which app is making the phone ring. Now the phone won't ring either.
* Fixed: Issue where a "TypeError" was being emitted if audio devices were toggled during an ongoing call. While this error did not affect any functionality, it was unnecessary and hence will not be emitted any more.


## v2.1.34 (released@ 19-10-2020)
**Bug Fixes**
 
* Fixed: Issue where onConnectionChange event was not getting triggered in the following scenarios: normal endpoint logout abrupt socket disconnection due to changed network conditions

* Fixed: Issue where one-way audio was being observed on calls made from Safari browser if audio input device (mic) is switched from one input source to another (Eg: from bluetooth mic to internal mic) during an ongoing call.
